Feed composition has changed dramatically in recent years and continues to evolve as resource availabilty changes. Yet, comprehensive understanding of the environmental implications of feed composition changes is lacking.\nWe are working towards a more holistic understanding of environmental pressures (greenhouse gas emissions, water extraction, nutrient pollution, habitat disturbance) from feed production and how these translate to impacts (e.g. biodiversity, ecosystem function) at local and global scales."
