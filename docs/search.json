Rich presented work in preparation on how raw material origins can be as important as feed composition for the environmental footprint of aquaculture feeds, and co-led a session on ’The Future of Sustainable Seafood in Australia’"

Over 70% of animal aquaculture is dependent on human-made ‘aquafeeds’ which can account for the majority of environmental impacts in the life-cycle of farmed fish. Aquafeeds thus present a key lever for improving the sustainability of the aquaculture sector."

Feed composition has changed dramatically in recent years and continues to evolve as resource availabilty changes. Yet, comprehensive understanding of the environmental implications of feed composition changes is lacking.\nWe are working towards a more holistic understanding of environmental pressures (greenhouse gas emissions, water extraction, nutrient pollution, habitat disturbance) from feed production and how these translate to impacts (e.g. biodiversity, ecosystem function) at local and global scales."
